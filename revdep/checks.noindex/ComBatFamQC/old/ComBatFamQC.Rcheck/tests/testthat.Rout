[1] "<strong>Note</strong>: The Bartlett's test is also a parametric test used for the same purpose as the Levene's test. Compared to the Levene's test, it is even more sensitive to departures from normality."
[1] "<strong>Note</strong>: The one-way ANOVA test is a statistical technique used to assess whether there are significant differences among the means of three or more groups. It requires meeting several assumptions to obtain reliable results."
[1] "<strong>Note</strong>: The Levene's test is a parametric test used to assess the equality of variances across multiple groups. It relies on the assumption of normality."
[1] "<strong>Note</strong>: The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare the medians of two or more groups, which serves as an alternative to the ANOVA test when the assumption of normality or equal variance is not met."
